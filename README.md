## Milestone 1 (7th April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

Mobile applications have become an integral part of our daily lives and their market grows rapidly. According to recent studies ([source 1](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/mobile-application-market#:~:text=Report%20Overview,13.8%25%20from%202023%20to%202030), [source 2](https://www.statista.com/statistics/292751/mobile-gaming-revenue-worldwide-device/#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20mobile%20games%20are,U.S.%20dollars%20in%20global%20revenue)), the global mobile application market size was valued at USD 206 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 13.8% from 2023 to 2030. Mobile games alone held the largest revenue share of more than 42% and are expected to generate approximately 92.2 billion U.S. dollars in annual revenue, accounting for 50% of the global gaming market in 2022 and overtaking the results obtained by AAA console and PC games. Gaming apps are then followed by Music & Entertainment, Social Networks, and Health and Fitness apps. 

With this growth and potential for profit, it is crucial for publishers and indie developers to understand what makes an app successful, and how to utilize the app store's potential to create the next million-dollar app. In this context, data visualization can be a powerful tool to gain insights and identify strategies to create popular apps, as well as highlight failure cases. Additionally, this visualization can be useful for marketers, investors, and researchers who are interested in understanding the dynamics of the mobile app market and its potential for growth.

The goal of this project is then to develop such visualizations by analyzing Google Play Store's data of 2.3 million+ applications together with  1.2 Million+ applications' data from Apple's AppStore.  Our visualization aims at showing the success factors of top-ranked apps: is there a relation between average rating and the number of installs? Does the app support ads and microtransactions? Is it free? Are there better monetization strategies for different categories?  Is there an underlying pattern among apps that manage to end up in the "Editor's Choice" section? All this and more with insightful and aesthetically pleasant visualizations.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Our exploratory data analysis can be found in this [notebook](https://github.com/com-480-data-visualization/project-2023-insightsquad/blob/master/initial_notebook.ipynb)

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
